This repository presents a curated body of academic work developed during my transition toward theoretical physics. It includes structured coursework-style assignments, independent theoretical reports, and undergraduate and master’s thesis research.

The material reflects sustained self-study and independent preparation in quantum field theory, general relativity, advanced mathematical methods, and topics related to AdS/CFT. Emphasis is placed on careful derivations, conceptual clarity, and technical development. Supporting computational work and numerical explorations are included where relevant.
