This repository contains selected coursework-style assignments, independent reports,
and thesis work compiled during my transition toward theoretical physics.

The material reflects self-study and independent preparation in quantum field theory,
general relativity, mathematical methods for physics, and topics related to AdS/CFT.
Both undergraduate and master’s level theses are included for completeness, along with
supporting computational work.

Folders:
- Assignments/: Coursework-style problem sets and written solutions (QFT, Group theory, Topology and Diff Geometry)
- Independent_Reports/: Longer self-contained theoretical reports
- BSc_Thesis/: Undergraduate (BSc) thesis
- MSc_Thesis/: Master’s (MSc) thesis
- Computational_Work/: Numerical simulations and code-based projects
